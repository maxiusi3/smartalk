# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the SmarTalk V2 design into a series of actionable development tasks based on the comprehensive Chinese requirements document (「开芯说SmarTalk」产品需求文档.md). Each task builds incrementally on previous work, following test-driven development principles and ensuring early validation of the core "First Deadly Contact" (首次致命接触) experience that drives user activation.

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics (From Chinese Requirements Document)
- **User Activation Rate**: ≥30% (users completing magic moment / total new users)
- **Next-Day Retention**: ≥40% (users returning within 24 hours of activation)
- **Core Learning Loop Success**: ≥80% (users completing pronunciation without rescue mode)

### Performance Targets
- **App Startup**: <2 seconds
- **Video Loading**: <1 second
- **Interaction Response**: <100 milliseconds
- **Screen Transitions**: <300 milliseconds
- **Pronunciation API Response**: <1.5 seconds

### Content Quality Standards
- **Mini-Drama Duration**: Exactly 30 seconds
- **Keywords Per Drama**: Exactly 5 core vocabulary items
- **Video Clips Per Keyword**: 2-4 clips from same drama
- **Error Recovery**: 100% user progression guarantee through Focus/Rescue modes

### User Experience Validation
- **Magic Moment Effectiveness**: Measured through self-assessment feedback correlation with retention
- **Error Recovery Success**: Focus Mode and Rescue Mode effectiveness in preventing user abandonment
- **Content Engagement**: Theme-specific completion rates and user satisfaction scores
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standard compliance across all features

## Implementation Priority and Dependencies

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Tasks 1-3)
Essential infrastructure, content management, and basic user flows. Must be completed before any user-facing features.

### Phase 2: Learning Engine (Tasks 4-5)
Core learning experience with error recovery and magic moment orchestration. The heart of the product value proposition.

### Phase 3: User Journey (Tasks 6-7)
Complete user experience with progress tracking, analytics, and performance optimization. Enables full user lifecycle management.

### Phase 4: Polish and Compliance (Tasks 8-9)
Accessibility, internationalization, testing, and quality assurance. Ensures production readiness and market compliance.

### Phase 5: Launch Preparation (Tasks 10-18)
Production deployment, user support, sharing mechanisms, and growth features. Enables successful market launch and organic growth.

## Critical Success Dependencies

### Content Production Pipeline
Tasks 12.1 and 12.2 (CMS and content toolchain) are critical blockers for content creation. Must be prioritized to enable parallel content production during development.

### Error Recovery Systems
Tasks 4.2 and 4.4 (Focus Mode and Rescue Mode) are essential for the zero-abandonment user experience promised in the requirements.

### Magic Moment Experience
Task 5 (Magic Moment Orchestration) is the core value proposition and primary activation driver. Requires careful attention to emotional design and ceremonial pacing.

### State Persistence
Task 11 (User State and Session Persistence) is critical for user retention and must be implemented early to prevent user frustration from lost progress.

### Performance Targets
All performance requirements (<2s startup, <1s video loading, <100ms interactions) must be validated continuously throughout development, not just at the end.

This comprehensive implementation plan ensures the complete "First Deadly Contact" experience is delivered according to all specifications in the Chinese requirements document, with sophisticated error recovery, performance optimization, scalable content management, comprehensive user support, and organic growth mechanisms for sustainable success.
