# SmarTalk Product Overview

SmarTalk is an English learning MVP app that addresses the "mute English" problem faced by Chinese learners. The product uses an "input-driven" approach through interactive mini-dramas to recreate natural language acquisition.

## Core Concept
- **Target User**: Adult learners (like "Alex", 33, e-commerce manager) with basic English knowledge but poor listening/speaking skills
- **Core Problem**: Traditional learning methods create knowledge without communication ability
- **Solution**: Comprehensible input through engaging mini-dramas with vTPR (virtual Total Physical Response)

## Key Features
- **First Deadly Contact**: 30-minute onboarding experience leading to the "magic moment" of understanding first drama without subtitles
- **Interest-Based Learning**: Content organized around travel, movies, and workplace themes
- **Keyword Wall**: Progressive vocabulary unlocking system
- **vTPR Practice**: Video-based comprehension exercises
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking for optimization

## Success Metrics
- User activation rate (completing first drama)
- Retention (7-day, 30-day)
